                <p>Made from start to finish by a cow horn artisan in Kampala, Uganda, our horn products sustainable and one of a kind. The raw horns (generated as a by-product of meat markets) until now have been sold by the slaughterhouses in bulk to Chinese buyers who export them back to Asia to mass produce buttons for their textile industry.</p>
                <p>Additionally, ranchers have been encouraged by economic development specialists to cross-breed their Ankole herds with jersey cows, in order to increase milk production. This practice, while it may present short-term profits for the rancher, presents a greater challenge for conservationists who are working to protect East Africa's rich biodiversity.</p>
