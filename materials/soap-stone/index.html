                <p>Soapstone is a metamorphic rock that consists of the mineral talc, also commonly referred to as steatite, it is known for being soft and easy to work with.</p>
                <p>Communities within Kisii have been using soapstone for generations, for many families, the carvings are their primary source of income.  Skills are passed down within families, some reaching three generations of carvers.  Each piece is individually hand crafted, from start to finish within a fair trade environment in Kisii.</p>
                <p>Soapstone occurs in a number of beautiful natural colours ranging from soft whites to marbled pinks, and grey tones. The color is dependent on the minerals present in the soapstone.  Due to soapstone being a natural material, veining and colour variations occur, leaving each piece completely unique.</p>
